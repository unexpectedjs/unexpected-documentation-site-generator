# The Unexpected documentation site generator

This is a documentation site generator extracted from
[unexpected](http://unexpectedjs.github.io/). This module in only
useful for building documentation sites for unexpected plugins and
unexpected itself.

Then you add the following scripts to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate-site": "generate-site --require ./bootstrap-unexpected-markdown.js",
  "update-examples": "generate-site --require ./bootstrap-unexpected-markdown.js --update-examples",
  "deploy-site": "deploy-site"
},
```

If you need a custom setup for your pages, you can add a bootstrap file:

You add a `bootstrap-unexpected-markdown.js` file to your project containing the
following code:

```js
// It is important that unexpected is global:
unexpected = require('unexpected');
unexpected.use(require('my-plugin'));
```

I know this is annoying but we need to control which version of unexpected is
used, and a peer dependency wont cut it.

Then you update your npm scripts to require the bootstrap file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate-site": "generate-site --require ./bootstrap-unexpected-markdown.js",
  "update-examples": "generate-site --require ./bootstrap-unexpected-markdown.js --update-examples",
  "deploy-site": "deploy-site"
},
```

### Other options

#### `--output <directory>`
Changes the default output directory from `site-build`

Now you are ready to add markdown files in a documentation directory. The
subfolders `assertions` and `api` are special. In the `assertions`
folder you add documentation for assertions grouped by type. In the
`api` folder you add documentation for api methods. See
[unexpected](https://github.com/unexpectedjs/unexpected/tree/master/documentation)
as an example on how to structure the documentation.
